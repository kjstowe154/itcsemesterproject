    <h2>What is Monster Rhythm?</h2>
    
    <p>Play as a magically musical young boy named Maestro. Maestro was born with a special talent that allows him to conduct 
        to the musically talented monsters in order to tame them! 

        One day there was a great boom that reverberated throughout the whole continent. Following that the local music 
        monsters started to act maliciously towards humans. Thankfully for the continent of music, Maestro can still save 
        the day.</p>
    
        <h2>GamePlay</h2>
    
        <p>Monster Rhythm is a top down rpg where you travel and explore the content to tame the monsters and figure out 
            what caused the loud boom and the aggro of the monsters.  
            In order to tame a monster you engage it in a musical battle! You will face off against the monster and a 
            musical staff will be summoned, and then the monster will play a rhythm that you have to match by tapping the 
            correct rhythm.</p>
